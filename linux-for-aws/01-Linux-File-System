# 📖 What is a Linux File System?

A **File System** is the method Linux uses to organize, store, and manage files and directories on a storage device.

Unlike Windows, Linux follows a **single hierarchical directory structure** that starts from the **Root Directory (`/`)**.

---

# 🌳 Linux Directory Structure

```text
/
├── bin
├── boot
├── dev
├── etc
├── home
├── lib
├── media
├── mnt
├── opt
├── proc
├── root
├── run
├── sbin
├── srv
├── sys
├── tmp
├── usr
└── var
```

Everything in Linux begins from the **Root Directory (`/`)**.

# 📁 Important Linux Directories

| Directory | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `/` | Root directory of the entire file system |
| `/home` | Home directory of normal users |
| `/root` | Home directory of the root user |
| `/etc` | System configuration files |
| `/var` | Variable data such as logs |
| `/usr` | Installed applications and libraries |
| `/tmp` | Temporary files |
| `/boot` | Boot loader and kernel files |
| `/dev` | Device files |
| `/proc` | Process and system information |
| `/media` | Automatically mounted removable devices |
| `/mnt` | Temporary mount point for storage devices |
| `/opt` | Optional third-party software |

---

# 📌 Important Directories Explained

## `/`

The **Root Directory** is the top-most directory in Linux.

Everything begins from here.

Example:

```text
/
├── home
├── etc
├── var
```

---

## `/home`

Stores files of normal users.

Example:

```text
/home/janvi
```

---

## `/root`

Home directory of the **root (administrator)** user.

> **Note:** `/` and `/root` are different.

---

## `/etc`

Contains configuration files for the operating system and installed applications.

Examples:

```text
/etc/passwd
/etc/hostname
/etc/hosts
```

---

## `/var`

Stores files that change frequently.

Examples:

- Log files
- Cache
- Mail
- Print queues

Most important location:

```text
/var/log
```

---

## `/usr`

Contains installed software, libraries, and documentation.

---

## `/tmp`

Stores temporary files created by applications.

Files in this directory may be removed after a system reboot.

---

# 💾 Mounting

## What is Mounting?

Mounting is the process of attaching a storage device to a directory so Linux can access it.

### Example

```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/data

sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/data
```

After mounting, the contents of the disk become available inside:

```text
/mnt/data
```

---

# 📄 Linux File Types

The **first character** in the output of `ls -l` indicates the file type.

Example:

```text
-rwxr-xr-x
```

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `-` | Regular File |
| `d` | Directory |
| `l` | Symbolic Link |
| `c` | Character Device |
| `b` | Block Device |

### Examples

Regular File

```text
-rw-r--r--
```

Directory

```text
drwxr-xr-x
```

Symbolic Link

```text
lrwxrwxrwx
```

# ☁️ AWS Connection

When working with AWS EC2, you'll frequently interact with these directories:

| Directory | AWS Usage |
|------------|-----------|
| `/etc` | Configure services like Nginx and SSH |
| `/var/log` | Troubleshoot application and system logs |
| `/home` | Store user files |
| `/mnt` | Mount Amazon EBS volumes |
| `/tmp` | Temporary application files |
| `/boot` | System boot files |

Understanding the Linux file system makes it easier to manage cloud servers efficiently.

# 📝 Key Takeaways

- Linux uses a single directory hierarchy starting from `/`.
- Every file and directory is organized under the Root Directory.
- `/etc` stores configuration files.
- `/var/log` stores system logs.
- `/home` contains user files.
- `/mnt` is commonly used for mounting storage devices.
- The first character in `ls -l` indicates the file type.
